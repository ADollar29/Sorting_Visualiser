# Sorting_Visualiser
roject Description
This sorting visualizer is a C++ application that employs the SDL2 library for rendering graphical representations of various sorting algorithms. The project demonstrates the efficiency and methodology of multiple sorting techniques, offering an interactive and visual learning experience. It's an excellent resource for students and developers alike to comprehend sorting algorithms' behavior and performance.

Sorting Algorithms Explained
Quick Sort: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a 'pivot' element and partitions the array around the pivot, sorting the partitions recursively.
Merge Sort: Another divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into halves, sorts each half, and then merges them.
Heap Sort: Builds a heap from the array and repeatedly extracts the maximum element to sort the array.
Insertion Sort: Builds the final sorted array one item at a time, inserting each new element into its proper place.
Tim Sort: A hybrid sorting algorithm, derived from merge sort and insertion sort, designed for efficiency on real-world data.
Selection Sort: Repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part and moves it to the beginning (or end).
Shell Sort: An in-place comparison sort that starts by sorting pairs of elements far apart from each other and progressively reducing the gap between elements to be compared.
Bubble Sort: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
Tree Sort: Builds a binary search tree from the elements and then traverses the tree in-order to get the sorted elements.
Cycle Sort: An in-place, unstable sorting algorithm, theoretically optimal in terms of memory writes, it is based on the idea of cycle decomposition.
Strand Sort: Works by repeatedly pulling sorted sublists out of the list to be sorted and merging them with the result array.
Cocktail Shaker Sort: A variation of bubble sort that sorts in both directions on each pass through the list.
Comb Sort: Improves on bubble sort by eliminating turtles, or small values near the end of the list.
Gnome Sort: Similar to insertion sort, but moving an element to its proper place is accomplished by a series of swaps, as in bubble sort.
Odd-Even Sort: A variation of bubble sort where the sorting is divided into two phases, odd and even.
Setting Up SDL2 Library
Based on the guide from WikiHow, here are the summarized steps to set up the SDL2 library:

Download SDL2: Visit the SDL website and download the SDL2 development library for Visual Studio.
Create a New Project in Visual Studio: Start Visual Studio and create a new C++ project.
Configure Your Project: Include the SDL2 headers and link the SDL2 libraries in your project settings.
Copy SDL2.dll: Place the SDL2.dll file in your project's executable directory.
Write Your Code: You can now start utilizing SDL2 functions in your C++ code.
Build and Run: Compile your project, ensuring that there are no errors, and then run it to see SDL2 in action.
GitHub Integration
For version control and collaboration, your project is integrated with GitHub. This provides a platform for tracking changes, managing issues, and collaborating with other developers.

This project not only enhances the understanding of sorting algorithms but also offers experience in using graphics libraries and version control systems. It's a comprehensive educational tool for both algorithmic concepts and practical software development skills.
